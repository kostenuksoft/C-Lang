# Repository features:

+ ## Editor codeit
  *codeit* - fairly simple file editor for Windows which comes in:

  - [WIN32 ver.](https://github.com/kostenuksoft/C-Lang/tree/development/WinAPI/codeit)

The versions offer very modest file editing functionality in console and win32 application experience.
